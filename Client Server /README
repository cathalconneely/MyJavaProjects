Demonstrates the use of client/server interaction. A client can send integer numbers to the server which 
adds each number to a global sum.

The server adds the received number to a global variable with type Integer, prints the new value of that 
variable (that is, the sum of the variable’s previous value and the received number), and responds to the 
client by sending message OK to the client. However, if adding the received number to the global variable 
would cause an overflow (that is, if the sum would be larger than the maximum value allowed for integers 
in Java), the server responds by sending ERROR to the client (instead of OK) and does not add the number
to the global sum.

If the client request is QUIT, then the server ends the connection to that client and prints “Connection 
to client ended”. No further messages are sent to that client.

I have created two server classes: one to demonstrate a basic server which handles a single client at a 
time, and one which handles multiple clients concurrently.
