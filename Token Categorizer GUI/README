This program contains a class TokenCategorizer with a main-method which accepts three arguments: the filename of a plain 
text file, a language code and a country code. Each token in the 
file specified by the filename should be put into exactly one of the following three categories integral numbers, 
real numbers  and any other tokens (separated by whitespace). 
Numbers should be scanned according to the locale specified by the given language and country code. 
Print the content of each category. 

Once the appropriate data is entered, the program opens a window which shows all tokens in a vertically 
scrollable table component with three columns named “Integral numbers”, “Real numbers”, 
“Other tokens”, corresponding to the three token categories. 
Also, the window contains a list component (type JList) which lists all 
permutations of the set of up to three tokens in the currently selected table row.

In the window's file options, “Open”  prompts the user for a file name and replaces the content of the table 
component and the list component appropriately using the tokens in the new file.
